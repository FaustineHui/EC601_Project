# EC601_Project
Project Name:

 Building 3D scenes from 2D images using ML algorithms

## Problem Statement

* Introduction:

This topic involves converting 2D images into 3D models through machine learning. The main step of applying machine learning algorithms is in the part of constructing a depth map from a 2D image. I expect to use point clouds for processing. According to the traditional 2D to 3D conversion, the specific method is as follows,

Use the 2D image as the left view to estimate the depth map --> Convert image to point cloud --> Get the right view by rendering the point cloud --> Build a 3D picture or model

The public's demand for 3D images, movies, and videos is increasing day by day. However, direct 3D shooting is relatively cumbersome and costly, resulting in insufficient 3D resources actually generated to meet the needs of the public. In addition, games and the two-dimensional culture are prevailing at the moment, and people are very interested in the 3Dization of 2D characters.
This project will be able to generate 3D pictures, videos or models from 2D images. To meet the public's demand for 3D resources. The project will use machine learning algorithms to complete fully automatic conversion and try to ensure a good look and feel of the output results.

* Target Customer:

Two-dimensional culture lovers, individual users, 3D modeling workers
